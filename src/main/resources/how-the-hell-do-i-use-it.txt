# ROADMAPS, WAYPOINTS AND EDGES

To get started, first create a roadmap. A roadmap represents a so-called
graph, a web of points and connections from one point to another.
Roadmaps (graphs) in this plugin are directed graphs, which means that
point A can be connected with point B, but B is not connected with point A.
So if navigation is used, this would represent a one way road.

To create a roadmap, use '/roadmap create <key>'. Afterwards, you can rename
it with '/roadmap set name <name>'. Keep in mind though, that the key of the
roadmap is permanent, so to administrators, the roadmap will always be named
the way you name it first.

If your roadmap has been created, you can then use '/roadmap editmode', to
activate the editmode and create points (so-called nodes or waypoints) and
edges.
Place waypoints at crossings and connected them along the roads, if used to
navigate through an actual roadmap.

# NODEGROUPS - DISCOVERING & NAVIGATING

To make waypoints discoverable as well as navigable, you have to assign them
to a nodegroup. Nodegroups carry all the important information:
- the name of the place to discover
- the search-terms for your gps system ('/find location searchtermA&searchtermB')
- if the group is actually discoverable
Nodegroups are used across all roadmaps independently, so if you create a
group 'towncenter' and use it twice on two different roadmaps, discovering
the town center of town A will also discover the town center of town B.

If this is not what you want to achieve, create two groups 'towncenterA' and
'towncenterB' and name them both 'towncenter' with 'nodegroup set name <group> <name>'

# PARTICLES

The way particles look to the user can be changed with pathvisualizers.
Pathvisualizers don't even require to be particles at all, they can also be
an entity moving along the path or a sound that has to be followed.
If you are into java development, you can extend pathvisualizers to your
requirements.
Otherwise, you can toggle everything possible with the /pathvisualizer command.
